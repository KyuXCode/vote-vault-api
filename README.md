## Install Prerequisites

- ### Install PostgreSQL
- ### Install php & Composer
  If you don't have PHP and Composer installed on your local machine, the following commands will install PHP, Composer, and the Laravel installer on macOS, Windows, or Linux: 
    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/mac)"
    ```
  After running one of the commands above, you should restart your terminal session. To update PHP, Composer, and the Laravel installer after installing them via php.new, you can re-run the command in your terminal. 
  If you already have PHP and Composer installed, you may install the Laravel installer via Composer:

    ```
    composer global require laravel/installer
    ```
